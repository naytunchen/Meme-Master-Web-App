Meme Collector and Editor Web App
===================================================

This is a project that I did for CSE 134B during the summer. The project includes Web app and chrome extension. It lets you save the Memes and pictures that you found on websites without downloading by using Meme Master Chrome Extension and create your own Meme as well. User can categorize (create albums), sort, and search their collected Memes by Name, Date, and Category.

Technology Used:
Client-side : HTML, CSS3, JavaScript (AJAX)
Server-side : Parse
