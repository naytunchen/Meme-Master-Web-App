					Team 9 consists of five UCSD students and was founded on July 3, 2014. The Team was inspired to create an innovative web application called MeMeMaster for enthusiastic meme browsers. 
					The users will be able to easily access the wide varieties of memes and GIFs around the internet.
					We intend to allow our users to save URLs of the memes and/or gifs that they like. 
					With the MemeMaster, the users are also be allowed to search memes, comment on them, 
					and create their own memes. Although our client is Thomas Powell, 
					we are committed to creating a website that everyone will come to love.
